## Introduction

This react boilerplate is a fast way, that is the base of powerful apps.

It is based on material ui, uses i18n translation, has already basic routes and menus, that 90%+ of the apps uses the same way.

## Contributing

The contribution is working this way:

1. Install the project dependencies `yarn install`
2. Run the project `yarn start`, if you see the template under `https//localhost:3000`, you are okay
3. Pick an issue and ask for assignment
4. Create a directory under src/screens/hacktoberfest/ and make there your component
5. Import your component in src/screens/hacktoberfest/Showcase.jsx and place it in the renderer with basic demo data, after that your Component should be visible under `https//localhost:3000/showcase`
6. If everything is fine, test the linter with `yarn lint`
7. If no errors, create a pull request and wait for approval :) 

Thats it!

## Important notes

- You may use material ui as design library (already in the project)
- You should try to work dependency free, try not to install any new dependency, if you need some, please let's discuss it in the issue.
- Please try to follow best practices and work honest, SPAM will not be tolerated

Thanks for your contribution! And don't forget to *star* the repository ;)
